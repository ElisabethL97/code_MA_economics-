# Overview
This repo shows the python code for the master thesis in economics:
"Machine Learning for Credit Risk Models: A Comparative Analysis"

The purpose of the thesis is to analyse if machine learning models can be used for credit risk analysis. More specifically, if they can be used for the prediction of the probability of default of a bank customer. 

The aim is to compare three classification models, namely random forest, XGBoost, and neural networks to a logistic regression model, to find out if the logistic regression model can be outperformed. 

# Setup 
The Repo consits of the following folders:
/exploratroive_data_analysis: displays the code for the exploratorive data analysis prior to the preprocessing //
/preprocessing: displays the code for the preprocessing steps of the data //
/models: displays the code for training and evaluating the four algorithms //

With this code base it should be possible to reconstruct the results of the thesis. 

# Dependencies
The requirements.txt file displays all packages necessary for the analysis.
